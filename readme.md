XML Notepad is a Windows program that provides a simple intuitive User Interface for browsing and editing XML documents. There are four ways to install it:
1. [ClickOnceÂ® installer](https://lovettsoftwarestorage.blob.core.windows.net/downloads/XmlNotepad/XmlNotepad.application) - this is the most convenient, install it directly from the web browser.
2. [Standalone downloadable installer](https://lovettsoftwarestorage.blob.core.windows.net/downloads/XmlNotepad/XmlNotepadSetup.zip) if you need something that works offline.
Just download the zip file, copy it to the machine you want to install it on, unzip the file on that machine and run `XmlNotepadSetup.msi`.
3. [Windows MSIX installer](https://lovettsoftwarestorage.blob.core.windows.net/downloads/XmlNotepad.Net/index.html) if you need a trusted Windows installer.
4. You can also use [WinGet](https://winget.run/pkg/Microsoft/XMLNotepad) as follows: `winget install XmlNotepad`
