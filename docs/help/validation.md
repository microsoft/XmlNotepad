## Validation

XML Notepad validates your document while you are editing and shows any errors or warnings in the Error List panel. You
can double click those errors to navigate to the node in error so you can then fix it.

XSD Schemas are located using the standard `xsi:schemaLocation` and `xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation` attributes where the `xsi`
prefix is bound to the `http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance` namespace or you can specify schemas using the [Schema
Dialog](schemas.md).

Once a schema is associated with your document you will also get prompted by [Intellisense](intellisense.md) for element
and attribute names and values.
